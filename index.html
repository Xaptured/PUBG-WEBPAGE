                    <h1>About BATTLEGROUNDS</h1>
                    <p>PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a competitive survival shooter formally developed/published by Bluehole. PUBG is now being developed by PUBG Corp, a Bluehole subsidiary company in cooperation with Brendan Greene (PLAYERUNKNOWN) as the Creative Director, PUBG is Greene's first standalone game.</p>
                    <p>Players are dropped into a wide, open area, and they must fight to the death - all while the battlefield shrinks, adding pressure to all in its grip. Use a variety of interesting weapons and vehicles amid the BATTLEGROUNDS. "Killing off another player cuts down on your competition, but it also offers up the opportunity to grab some loot. Your character can only carry around a limited amount of gear, so there are important questions to ask whenever you come across new items. Is it better to stick with your current 9mm pistol, or hold out hope that you'll be able to find ammo for a found 12 gauge shotgun?"</p>
                    <p>PUBG Mobile is running on Unreal Engine 4, players take on the Battle Royale experience on a map called "Erangel."</p>

                        <h3>ERANGEL MAP</h3>
                        <p>Erangel is the base map for the game. An 8x8 km map dotted with small outcroppings of buildings, the distance between major landmarks necessitates the use of vehicles to move between areas. As the game continues, the map area will be restricted to a smaller and smaller play area. A red circle will appear on the map from time to time, marking an area for offshore artillery to bombard. Erangel has varying weather, sometimes affecting visibility and requiring a change in tactics.</p>

                        <h3>MIRAMAR MAP</h3>
                        <p>Miramar is the 2nd playable map for BATTLEGROUNDS. Initially slated to be a 4x4 km map, Miramar is a 8x8km city-centric map with an open desert plain and rural areas.Miramar offers unique terrain and dense urban areas. With an island to the south east home to a prison and smaller villages, the entire area is cut off from the west and north-east by enormous canyons and mountains, with a looming metal wall to the north keeping outsiders out, and players in. Miramar will create a new Battle Royale experience where the old strategies from Erangel may no longer work and new tactics are required.</p>

                        <p>Sanhok (Codename: Savage) is the 3rd playable map but the 4th map in total for BATTLEGROUNDS, Sanhok is a 4x4km island compared to other maps that are 8x8km. Sanhok is the first map where BATTLEGROUNDS implemented a dynamic circle. This dynamic circle sees how many players are alive then will calculate if the blue zone should move faster or slower throughout the match.Sanhok is the first map that the art team of PUBG Corp visited a location specifically for world art development. By physically being in the jungles and mountains in a humid Asian country, it not only made them imagine what the new map will play like, but they felt the breeze, smelled the air and heard the sounds. All of these experiences are helping the team create a unique map experience.</p>

                        <p>Vikendi (Codename: Dihorotok) is the 4th playable map that is in the works for BATTLEGROUNDS, Vikendi is a 6x6 island on the Adriatic Sea.An isolated Northern resort island in the shadow of Mount Kreznic, Vikendi was home to a wide variety of attractions, businesses and villages. Vikendi is enveloped in dense/thick forest and another aspect of the island is its warm Mediterranean coastline and snowy mountains in the central area of the map [3] [4]. Tourists can look to the future from the Cosomodrome, travel back to the past and walk with the giants at the prehistoric Dino Park, visit the aging Castle or even take a tour of the winery. Vikendi is as beautiful as it is dangerous and Survivors treading these bitter cold lands will have to watch their backs even more closely, as the fresh snow is perfect for leaving behind footprints!</p>
